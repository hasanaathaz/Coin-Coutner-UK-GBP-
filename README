Description:

This Python project implements an image processing application designed to count money using a webcam. It addresses potential shortcomings of the previous versions by incorporating the following enhancements:

Enhanced Tracking: The code implements a more sophisticated approach to track contours based on area, white pixel count, and potential size ranges for different denominations. This improves accuracy in identifying and counting coins and bills.
Color Detection: The code defines custom color ranges (HSV values) for money and incorporates a white pixel count threshold to potentially distinguish between coins and bills. This allows for more robust detection even under varying lighting conditions.
Error Handling: The code addresses the previously encountered NameError by ensuring that imgColor is only displayed if it's defined within the loop. Additionally, you can consider implementing checks for missing libraries or invalid parameter values to enhance robustness.
Key Features:

Captures video from a webcam
Utilizes OpenCV and cvzone libraries for image processing
Applies pre-processing techniques like blurring, edge detection, and morphological operations
Identifies contours (potential objects) in the preprocessed image
Analyzes contours based on area, white pixel count, and defined ranges
Counts different denominations based on the analysis
Displays the total counted money on the screen
Getting Started:

Install Requirements: Ensure you have OpenCV, cvzone, and NumPy installed (pip install opencv-python cvzone numpy).
Run the Script: Execute the main Python script (main.py) to start the application.
Adjust Trackbars (Optional): The code uses trackbars for color threshold adjustments. You can modify these values in the "Settings" window if needed.
Notes:

The current color detection may require further calibration based on your lighting conditions. You might need to fine-tune the HSV values in the hsvVals dictionary for optimal results.
Consider exploring more advanced color detection algorithms for enhanced accuracy in real-world scenarios.
Disclaimer:

This project is intended for educational and demonstration purposes only. It may not achieve perfect accuracy in counting money due to factors like lighting variations, overlapping objects, and camera angle.
